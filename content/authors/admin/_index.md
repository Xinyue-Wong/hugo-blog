  I graduated from School of Journalism and Communication at Shandong University. My research focuses on Computational Social Science, especially information diffusion on social networks, dynamic mechanisms involved in network evolution, and online collaborative actions.

Iâ€™m also interested in:  
  a. Complex Network  
  b. Science of Science  
  c. Cognitive Communication  
  d. Information and Communication Technologies  

What I want to know:  
  a. What are the micro-communication phenomena? How are the macroscopic-microscopic communication phenomena related?  
  b. What is the dynamic communication structure?  
  c. How are connections or networks made?  
  d. What can complex system methods and computational methods bring to social science?
