title: In COMputation Island
---

I’m an editor of **COMputation Island (“计传岛” in Chinese)** . **COMputation Island** is a WeChat-based online platform for developing computational communication research (CCR) and computational social science research, founded by [Yingdan Lu](https://yingdanlu.com/account/) from Stanford University, and co-founded with [Yiyan Zhang](https://yiyanzhang.com/) from Boston University and [Zening Duan](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=EnJAHNsAAAAJ&hl=en) from the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

In October 2022, I published a WeChat article of **Agent-Based Modeling** ([Article Link](https://mp.weixin.qq.com/s?__biz=Mzg5MDU2MjgyNg==&mid=2247485538&idx=1&sn=83067f157b842a068107873833c04d11&chksm=cfdbf807f8ac71112bc91eca6d10ef2b51379d79306d7839a4890ad60a0ae2652c278d1e9d1a&token=1711582554&lang=zh_CN)) in cooperation with [Joyce Jiang](https://www.jiangyanru.com/) from UCLA and Xinyue Chen from Peking University. This article provides an easy-to-understand introduction to **Agent-Based Modeling**. We provide several pieces of information on the advantages, functions, applications, controversies, and limitations of Agent-Based Modeling. We also list some tools and learning materials for **Agent-Based Modeling**.
